**It's a scoring subject**

***VIMP: Use Duolingo (Application) for practicing Japanese, but it's too slow, So from the rise of sem use it so that you get familiar with Japanese.Also, you can learn Hiragana, Katakana a bit faster here

Mostly One of the tests would be written and for other tests there would be assignment submission

***For Assignment Submission***:

1. Try to write most parts in Japanese (You can refer to and copy Japanese as it is)
2. Sir gave 20/20 for assignment submission to most ppl who wrote mostly in Japanese.
3. Write precisely and most important properly.

***For T2 : ***

1. Make sure you cover all the points instructed by the instructor.
2. Practice Hiragana (Dont miss Dakuten and Tenten, because they are surely asked)


***For End Sem: ***

1. Our whole paper was in hiragana and katakana.So master hiragana and katakana.
2. For kanji (Mostly focus on some basic words taken by your tutor, also there's one book in the END SEM folder refer to that for studying).
3. don't take assignments lightly, Those were asked in exams, Even theory like 5SS was asked for 6 marks


Study well, Wish you all the best guys :)
